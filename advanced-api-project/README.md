# Advanced API Development with Django REST Framework

In the "Advanced API Development with Django REST Framework" project, you will expand your skills in API development by working on advanced concepts such as custom serializers, custom views, filtering, searching, ordering, and testing. By the end of this project, you will be able to create robust and efficient APIs that handle complex data structures and provide advanced wuerying capabilities.

> [!NOTE]
> ## Learning Objectives
> By the end of this project, you will be able to:
> 1. **Set up a new Django project with Custom Serializers in Django REST Framework:**
>   - Initiate a new Django project tailored for advanced API development.
>   - Create custom serializers to handle complex data structures and nested relationships.
> 2. **Build Custom Views and Generic Views in Django REST Framework:**
>   - Construct custom views and utilize generic views to handle specific use cases and streamline API development.
> 3. **Implementing Filtering, Searching, And Ordering in Django REST Framework:**
>   - Enhance the usability and functionality of your API by adding filtering, searching, and ordering capabilities.
> 4. **Write Unit Tests for Django REST Frameworks APIs:**
>   - Develop and execute comprehensive unit tests to ensure the integrity of your API endpoints and the correctness of response data and status codes.

> [!TIP]
> ## Tasks
> Task One
> - This task asks the learner to set up a new django project with Django Rest Framework, defining models and custom serializers
> Task Two
> - This task asks the learner to set up custom views and generic views in Django REST Framework, setting up urls, while also setting up permissions to protect API endpoints based on user roles.
> Task Three
> - This task asks the learner to implement filtering, searching, and ordering in Django REST Framework, providing the users with the tools to easily access and manipulate the data presented through the API
> Task Four
> - This task asks the learner to write tests for the Django REST Framework APIs to ensure integrity of the endpoints and the correctnes of response data and status codes.
