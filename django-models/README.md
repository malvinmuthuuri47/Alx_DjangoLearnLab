# Deep Dive into Django Models and Views

> [!NOTE]
> In this project, "Deep Dive into Django Models and Views", you will advance your skills in using Django, a high-level Pyhon web framework. This project is designed for novice learners aiming to solidify their understanding of Django's ORM capabilities, view configurations, and user authentication features.
> Through a series of hands-on tasks, you will implement complex model relationships, develop both function-based and class-based views, and manage user authentication and permissions.
> By the end of this project, you will have a comprehensive understanding of how to build robust and scalable web applications using Django.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ## Learning Objectives
> By the End of this project, you will be able to:
> 1. Implement Advanced Model relationships in Django:
>    - Master Django's ORM capabilities by creating models that demonstrate ForeignKey, ManyToMany, and OneToOne relationships.
>    - Effectively model complex data relationships in a Django project.
> 2. Develop Django Views and URL Configuration:
>    - Gain proficiency in creating function-based and class-based views in Django.
>    - Configure URL patterns to handle web requests effectively, routing them to the appropriate views.
> 3. Manage User authentication in Django:
>    - Set up user login, logout, and registration functionalities using Django's built-in authentication system.
>    - Develop views and templates to demonstrate user session and permission management.
> 4. Implement Role-base Access Control in Django:
>    - Estend the Django User model to include user roles and create views that restrict access based on these roles.
>    - Utilize Django signals automatically to create a UserProfile when a new user is registered.
> 5. Implement Custom Permissions in Django:
>    - Add custom permissions to the Book model to control actions such as adding, editing, and deleting entries based on user roles.
>    - Enforce these permissions in views, ensuring only authorized users can perform specific actions.

> [!TIP]
> 1. Task One
>    - This task aims to help the learner master Django's ORM capabilties by creating a set of models that demonstrate the use of <span style="color: red">ForeignKey</span>, <span style="color: red">ManyToMany</span>, and <span style="color: red"><OneToOne/span> relationships. This task will help you understand how to model complex data relationships in a Django project effectively.
> 2. Task Two
>    - This task aims to help the user understand Django views and URL configurations. The objective is to develop proficiency in creating both function-based and class-based views in Django, and configuring URL patterns to handle web requests effectively. This task will help you understand different ways to define views and manage URL routing in Django.
> 3. Task Three
>    - This task is about implementing user authentication in Django. The objective of this task is to develop the ability to manage user authentication within a Django application. This task focuses on setting up user login, logout, and registration functionalites using Django's built-in authentication system.
> 4. Task Four
>    - This task is about implementing role-based access control in Django to manage different user roles and permission effectively. The learner is meant to extend the user model and create views that restrict access based on user roles.
> 5. Task Five
>    - This task focuses on implementing custom permissions in Django. The objective is to implement custom permissions in a Django application to control access to specific actions such as adding, editing, and deleting book entries based on user roles. This task provides the learner with guidelines to creating permissions in the model and enforcing them in views.
