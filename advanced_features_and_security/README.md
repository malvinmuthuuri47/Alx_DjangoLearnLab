# Advanced Features and Security

> [!NOTE]
> In the "Advanced Features and Security" project, you will delve into crucial aspects of Django development that ensure the robustness and security of web applications. This project is designed for you to enhance your understanding of custom user models, permissions, security practices, and secure communication in Django applications.
> Through a series of tasks, you will implement custom user models, manage permissions and groups, apply security best practices, and configure HTTPS and secure redirects. By the end of this project, you will be equipped with the skills to build secure and efficient Django applications.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ## Learning Objectives
> By the End of this project, you will be able to:
> 1. Implement a Custom User Model in Django:
>    - Customize Django's user model to include additional fields and functionality.
>    - Configure settings and integrate the custom user model into the Django admin.
> 2. Manage Permissions and Groups in Django:
>    - Implement and manage permissions and groups to control access to various parts of your application.
>    - Develop views that enforce these permissions and document the setup process.
> 3. Apply Security Best Practices in Django:
>    - Configure Django settings to prevent security vulnerabilities and ensure data privacy.
>    - Protect views and templates against common security threats such as CSRF, XSS, and SQL Injection.
> 4. Implement HTTPS and Secure Redirects in Django:
>    - Configure Django to handle secure HTTPS connections and enforce HTTPS redirects.
>    - Adjust settings for secure cookies and implement secure headers to protect against various attacks.

> [!TIP]
> 1. Task One
>    - This task's objective is to customize Django's user model to suit the specific needs of your application, demonstrating an understanding of extending Django's authentication system.
>    - For this task, you will replace Django's default user model with a custom user model that includes additional fields and functionality. This is a critical feature for applications that require user attributes beyond Django's built-in user model.
> 2. Task Two
>    - This task's objective is to implement and manage permissions and groups to control access to various parts of your Django applications, enhancing security and functionality.
>    - You will develop a system within your Django application that utilizes groups and permissions to restrict access to certain parts of your application. This task will demonstrate your ability to set up detailed access controls based on user roles and their assigned permissions.
> 3. Task Three
>    - This task is about implementing security best practices in Django. You will apply best practices for securing a Django application. This task will guide you through enhancing the security of your application by configuring various Django settings and writing secure code.
> 4. Task Four
>    - This task is about implementing HTTPS and Secure Redirects in Django. The objective is about enhancing the security of your Django application by configuring it to handle secure HTTPS connections and enforce HTTPS redirects for all HTTP prectices for secure web communication.
